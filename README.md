# repomarks
This repo is an organized list of repositories I find interesting.

## Why?
I've found myself starring a very large amount of repositories here on GitHub, but found the interface a bit lacking in organization:
- There is no way to directly follow a person or organization
- I can't organize my starred repos into folders or anything like that
- And starring doesn't mean that I get notified about anything happening in those repos, I need to __watch__ them for that

So, until I have a better solution (either some new tool or GitHub updating its interface), I'll just create a list with whatever organization I want, to help me navigate my own interests.
